      <h4>Cryptocurrency Paper</h4>
     <p> In my last semester at USF, I was tasked with researching two topics that concerned the field of Information Science. 
         I choose the strengths of Cryptocurrencies and the role of A. I in education as my topics of research due to my interests in these. 
         These interests stem from my desire to be part of the upcoming A. I revolution, and the creation of humanoid artificial intelligence. 
         The papers and their respective presentations will be presented below:</p>
